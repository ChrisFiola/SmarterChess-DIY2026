# Super Smart Chessboard Revival

## UPDATE 2026
I'm trying to revive this project in 2026. i want to be able to play chess IRL and record my moves so I can study them online.

I am starting from the original DIY Machines's project and will update the code to make it work on a raspberry pi pico instead of arduino.

The original code is not compatible with the latest python updates and is hardly running on the latest Stockfish.

## Original README
Play remotely over the internet, or locally against the inbuilt computer.

==========

Though this board has a great single player mode, If you build two, and bond them together digitally you then send one to a friend or loved one so you that you can play chess together over the internet with real chess pieces and only a few seconds of delay. It’s a great way to share some time and to connect with people who are physically distant.

Here are a few more features:

■ Check your moves are legal and warn you when you don't play by the rules

■ Suggest what would be a good next move for you

■ Entirely 3D printable including the chess pieces

■ Very cool looking LED lighting to convey the game status and provide the lighting for evening games

■ Smart control panel which guides you through how to use the board with intelligent backlighting

■ Small and low cost OLED screen to help guide you through using it

■ Powered by USB, so you can connect it to mains or run it from a common USB battery pack for untethered play

The internet connectivity, computer opponent and rule checking are handled by a Raspberry Pi, whilst the lighting and buttons are taken care of by an Arduino Nano.
